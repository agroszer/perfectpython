This extension for Komodo 7 adds PEP 8 and Pyflakes syntax checking.

I plan to add pylint support too. Komodo's built in support does not
make use of your project's additional import directories, so it keeps
complaining about being unable to import modules and classes being wrong.

I also plan to add a preferences screen to allow configuration (e.g. the
maximum line length before it complains, error codes to ignore, etc.).
I don't know how to do this yet, and the extension works pretty well for
me already, so we'll see if I ever get around to it.
