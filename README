This is an extension for Komodo 7 that adds PEP 8 syntax checking.

I plan to add pyflakes and (hopefully) pylint support, built into the extension.

Komodo's built in support for pyflakes and pylint requires installing these
tools separately.

Komodo's built in pylint support does not make use of your project's
additional import directories, so it keeps complaining about being unable
to import modules.
