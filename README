This extension for Komodo 7 adds PEP 8, Pylint, and Pyflakes syntax checking.

Everything is built into the extension, so no other installation is required.
It also avoids bugs that are in Komodo's built-in implementation.

Check the preferences under "Syntax Checking" > "Perfect Python"

Ideas for future versions:

* Add more options for pylint (relatively easy)

* Allow preferences to be set at the project and file level (difficult)
** Maybe a toolbar or context menu with 3 buttons that visibly show on/off for each pref level
